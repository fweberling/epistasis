# Structural epistasis analysis

Scripts to preprocess deep mutational scanning (DMS) data. The data are analysed for combinability of mutations and the effect of epistasis.

If a residue distance matrix is available, structural epistasis graphs can be generated that visualise combinability hotspots and their centrality in the protein.
